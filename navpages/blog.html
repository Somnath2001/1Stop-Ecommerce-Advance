                                    <p><span>Did you know there are about a thousand Aloe Vera skin benefits and uses?</span> From collagen production to relieving dandruff, Aloe Vera gel has you covered for whatever your concerns may be. In this post, we’ll break down all the amazing reasons why you need to grab you a bottle (or a leaf) ASAP!With summer in full swing, my skin care cabinet would not be complete without my huge bottle of Aloe Vera Gel. Aloe Vera has so many benefits and uses for the skin, you won’t believe it! In this post, I’ll break it all down, plus show you exactly how you can use it in your own beauty routine! </p>
                                    <p><span>Why Does Aloe Benefit the Skin?</span>
                                        Aloe vera gel contains two hormones: Auxin and Gibberellins.
                                        
                                        These two hormones provide wound healing and anti-inflammatory properties that reduce skin inflammation. Giberellin in aloe vera acts as a growth hormone stimulating the growth of new cells. 
                                        
                                        Aloe allows the skin to heal quickly and naturally with minimal scarring.   It is antibacterial, antiviral, and anti fungal!  You can see why it’s excellent for acne.
                                        
                                        Aloe contains antioxidants like beta carotene, vitamin C and E.   These are amazing qualities that make aloe excellent for moisturizing and anti aging! 
                                        
                                        While my dry skin needs more the aloe to be moisturizing enough on it’s own, it can be a fantastic moisturizer for oilier skin types. It is oil free, light and locks in moisture without feeling contributing to your own oils.
                                        
                                        When applied to the skin, aloe vera gel has been shown to help fight bacteria, reduce inflammation, and promote wound healing.
                                        
                                        Aloe vera contains lupeol, salicylic acid, urea nitrogen, cinnamonic acid, phenols, and sulfur, all of which kill bacteria that might cause acne.</p>
                                    <p><span>Aloe Vera Gel May Help Hyperpigmentation and Collagen Production</span>
                                        According to one study, when applied four times per day for 15 days, aloe was found to be effective in treating UV-induced and post-acne hyperpigmentation.
                                        
                                        Another study found that the topical application of aloe can inhibit hyperpigmentation from producing more melanin, the pigment that, when overproduced, causes dark spots to form.    
                                        
                                        In addition to its ability to help replenish and retain moisture in the skin, aloe also stimulates the production of hyaluronic acid and collagen and elastin fibers in the skin—all of which are what we need to keep skin hydrated, firm, and supple. Collagen, elastin and hyaluronic acid decline naturally with age. </p>
                                        
                                
                                        <p> <span>How to Use an Aloe Vera Plant:</span>
                                        It might seem daunting to grow your own aloe plant and actually use it-it was for me until I found HUGE aloe stems at Whole Foods.
                                        
                                        Aloe leaves are in the produce section of Whole Foods and are very cheap.
                                        
                                        I excitedly grabbed one to experiment and found that while you don’t really get much of a “gel” consistency, the slimy sliver that is inside the green exterior can be rubbed on the skin to relieve cuts and burns and other skin concerns.
                                        
                                        You can rub the aloe sliver on your skin as a moisturizer or mask as well. You can even freeze cut aloe squares to prolong the shelf life. (see picture below)
                                        
                                        I eventually realized you can put the insides of the leaf in your blender or food processor and make the gel that we are used to in a bottle.
                                        
                                    If this is the method you choose to use aloe, be sure to store it in the fridge. Without a preservative, your handmade aloe gel will go bad within weeks.</p>  
                                      <p><span>How to Make an Aloe Vera Face Mask:</span>
                                        Mix aloe and add 4 drops of essential oils (optional) in a bowl.
                                        Apply the mask to your face and let sit for 10 minutes. 
                                        Rinse your face with cool water and pat dry.   
                                        Follow up with a toner and moisturizer to lock the moisture in.
                                        *You can add in clays for a detoxing mask! In order to know how much, go slow when adding the 2 ingredients. Get the texture right and your mask will be great!
                                        
                                        <span>How to Use Aloe Vera For Acne:</span>
                                        Scrape the gel out of an aloe leaf with a spoon or use a dime sized amount of gel.
                                        Apply the gel to your skin. 
                                        No need to rinse.
                                        Repeat 1–2 times per day.
                                        How to Use Aloe Vera as a Scalp Mask:
                                        Apply aloe gel to your roots, massaging as you go. 
                                        Leave on for 20 minutes.
                                        Shampoo/condition as usual.</p>

                                      <p>I always use Mountain Rose Herbs Aloe Vera Gel.  It’s pesticide free, and comes from the inner fillet of the leaf which is where it is most potent.  Their aloe comes from certified organically grown aloe vera plants.  In fact, it’s so pure, you can drink it!

                                        The MRH gel contains 99.8% pure organic aloe vera, and natural preservatives and stabilizers consisting of Potassium Sorbate, and Citric Acid at a percentage not to exceed 0.3%.
                                        
                                        Another reason I love MRH’s aloe because it’s not sticky.  It goes on smooth, sinks in quickly and doesn’t leave a tight, uncomfortable layer of product.  I used to avoided aloe like the plague due to how uncomfortable it was when applied to sunburns, rashes or dry skin until I found Mountain Rose Herbs.</p>
